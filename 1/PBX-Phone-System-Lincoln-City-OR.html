<p>But cloud phone systems eliminate the PBX metaphor and rather choose a different concept: Unified Communications (UC). Some functions, such as voicemail to text, are unique to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office could get by easily with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, however the advanced functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Enterprise are tempting for a couple of dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Group Existence status indication (both included in Office Pro Plus) are useful upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anywhere app (Office Enterprise).</p>
