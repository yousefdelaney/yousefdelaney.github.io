<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as companies and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to an advanced system. There is a substantial variety of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephone systems services) for less expensive call rates than traditional telephony providers. The software and hardware is economical, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, cordless "locations" in areas such as coffee shops, airports, and parks enable you to link to the Internet and may enable you to utilize VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
